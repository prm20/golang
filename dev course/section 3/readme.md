# Golang Section 3

This will be where my project for section 3 is housed

## Description

The purpose of section 3 is to create a project written on golang that does the following:

* create a function(s) that will do the following:
  * create a deck of cards
    * in order to create deck, use _for loop_ to concatenate the values and suits
  * print cards on screen
    * in order to constantly avoid using fmt.Println()
  * that deals the cards out
  * converts from slicer to set of strings
  * save to local machine and also create a new deck from file on local machine
  * lastly to shuffle the cards 
* create a set of tests in the _test.go_ file
